# WebProject-YourAnimeList
This is a school group project for web development project.

 The motivation for the project was creating an anime database that we can have users classify their most favorite anime and evaluate them. Thus, the creation of this projected originated from an idea of having our centralized anime database where we can add anime reviews about different anime we have watched and see how it was received by others. This project was based on the idea that anyone can go to the website and look at the descriptions, reviews of each show before picking it up.

# Rule
Users can sign up or log in on any page
Users can search for an anime using the search bar or select an anime from the main page
Users can leave a review on the anime’s page if they are logged in
That user’s reviews can be viewed from their user page after they are submitted
